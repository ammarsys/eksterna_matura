# Eksterna Matura

This application was created for my middle school that way students can test themselves for the end-year exam known as
"Eksterna Matura". On the frontend, it uses `pure JS`. It utilises the `Flask` framework and in-memory `SQlite` database. 
All data stored is for analytical purposes.

At the moment, this project isn't production ready so there isn't a live instance of it on the web.

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/novusys/eksterna_matura
